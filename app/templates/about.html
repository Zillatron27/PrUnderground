    <h1><div class="spinner-data spinner-sm"></div> About PrUnderground</h1>

    <p>A community trade registry for <a href="https://prosperousuniverse.com/">Prosperous Universe</a> players. List what you sell, find what you need.</p>

    <p>Discord trading channels aren't great for finding buyers and sellers off market - messages scroll away, searches are of questionable value and not everyone wants to make an elaborate spreadsheet.</p>

    <p>PrUnderground fixes that. Connect your FIO account, list what you're selling, and share your storefront with your corp or community.</p>
